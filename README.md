Introduction:  ## for flight price ##
The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on flight price data is to gain insights and knowledge about the dataset using visual and descriptive statistics methods. The dataset contains historical flight prices from different airlines and routes.

Data Source:
The dataset used for this EDA was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10 columns and 10683 rows.

Columns:
The columns in the dataset are:

Airline: The name of the airline
Source: The source city of the flight
Destination: The destination city of the flight
Route: The route taken by the flight
Departure Time: The time at which the flight departs
Arrival Time: The time at which the flight arrives
Duration: The total duration of the flight
Total Stops: The total number of stops in the flight
Additional Info: Additional information about the flight
Price: The price of the flight
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Data Cleaning: The data was checked for missing values and duplicates. Missing values were imputed or removed as appropriate, and duplicates were removed.

Univariate Analysis: The distribution of the target variable (Price) was checked for normality. The distributions of other variables were checked for skewness and outliers.

Bivariate Analysis: The relationship between the target variable (Price) and the other variables was explored. The correlation between the continuous variables was checked using a correlation matrix.

Multivariate Analysis: The interactions between multiple variables were explored. The relationship between the categorical variables and the target variable was explored using boxplots.

Conclusion:
This EDA helped to gain insights and knowledge about the dataset. The relationships between the variables were explored, and the dataset was cleaned of missing values and duplicates. The results of this analysis can be used to develop a predictive model to estimate flight prices.







Introduction:  ## for google play store##
In this task, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Google Play Store dataset. The dataset contains information about various apps that are available on the Google Play Store. The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps

The dataset contains two files:

googleplaystore.csv: This file contains the details of the apps that are present on the Google Play Store. The details include the app name, category, rating, number of reviews, size, installs, type of app (free or paid), price, content rating, genre, last updated date, and current version.

googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv: This file contains the user reviews of the apps that are present on the Google Play Store. The details include the app name, review text, and sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

Objective:
The objective of this task is to explore and analyze the Google Play Store dataset using various data visualization techniques and statistical methods.

Steps involved:

Loading the dataset and checking for missing values and data types.
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using data visualization techniques.
Statistical analysis of the dataset.
Conclusion.
Let's start by loading the dataset and checking for missing values and data types




Overview ## students performnce  ##
This repository contains data and code for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student performance data. The data is in the form of a CSV file, and the code is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Data
The data in the CSV file contains information about student performance in math, reading, and writing exams. It includes the following columns:

gender: the gender of the student (male or female)
race/ethnicity: the race/ethnicity of the student (group A, group B, group C, group D, or group E)
parental level of education: the highest level of education achieved by the student's parent (some high school, high school, some college, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, or master's degree)
lunch: whether or not the student received free or reduced-price lunch (standard or free/reduced)
test preparation course: whether or not the student completed a test preparation course (none or completed)
math score: the student's score on the math exam (out of 100)
reading score: the student's score on the reading exam (out of 100)
writing score: the student's score on the writing exam (out of 100)
Code
The code for conducting the EDA is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It includes the following steps:

Loading the data from the CSV file
Checking for missing values and dealing with them if necessary
Exploring the data using summary statistics, histograms, and box plots
Investigating relationships between variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices
Drawing conclusions based on the EDA and identifying any further analyses that may be necessary
The code is well-documented with comments explaining each step, and can be easily modified or extended as needed.

Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download them both from the official websites:

Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install.html
Once you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, you can clone this repository and run the code in the student_performance_analysis.ipynb file.

Acknowledgments
The data used in this EDA is from the Kaggle dataset "Students Performance in Exams" (https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams). The dataset was originally created by Shahmir Resai.





Overview ## for forest fire ##
This repository contains data and code for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on forest fire data. The data was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of measurements of meteorological variables and the burned area of forest fires in Portugal.

The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the patterns and relationships in the data, and to identify any important variables or trends that may be useful for predicting forest fires.

Files
forestfires.csv: This is the main data file containing measurements of meteorological variables and the burned area of forest fires. The file is in comma-separated value (CSV) format.
forest_fire_eda.ipynb: This is a Jupyter notebook containing the code for conducting the EDA on the forest fire data. The notebook is written in Python and uses the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
Instructions
To run the code in the forest_fire_eda.ipynb notebook, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
